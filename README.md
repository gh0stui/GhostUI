# *GhostUI*: Unveiling Hidden Interactions in Mobile UI

[![Dataset](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dataset-Hugging%20Face-yellow)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ghostui/ghostui)

***GhostUI*** is the first comprehensive dataset specifically designed to capture and analyze hidden interactions in mobile applicationsâ€”interactions that lack visible cues but are triggered by gestures such as swipe, long press, or double tap.

## Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation of the *GhostUI* research project, including:

- **UI Probing Tool**: Automated tool for discovering interactions in mobile apps
- **Dataset Annotation Interface**: Web-based tool for annotating and validating hidden interactions
- **Validation Guidelines**: Structured framework for evaluating hidden interactions

## Dataset
The complete ***GhostUI*** dataset is available on Hugging Face:
**[ðŸ”— GhostUI Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ghostui/ghostui)**

*The dataset contains *1,970* hidden interactions across *81* mobile applications.*

## Components

### 1. UI Probing Tool (`ui_probing_tool/`)

An automated python tool that systematically explores mobile application interfaces to discover *hidden interactions*.

**Key Features:**
- Automated gesture execution (tap, swipe, long press, etc.)
- Screenshot capture and UI hierarchy analysis
- Interactive element detection and annotation

See [`ui_probing_tool/README.md`](ui_probing_tool/README.md) for detailed setup and usage instructions.

### 2. Dataset Annotation Interface (`validation_tool/`)

A Next.js web application for annotating, validating, and analyzing collected interaction datasets.

**Key Features:**
- Interactive dataset browsing and filtering
- Annotation guidelines and validation criteria
- Real-time decision recording and export
- Keyboard navigation for efficient annotation

See [`validation_tool/README.md`](validation_tool/README.md) for setup and usage instructions.

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gh0stui/GhostUI.git
   cd GhostUI
   ```

2. **Set up UI Probing Tool**
   ```bash
   cd ui_probing_tool
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # See ui_probing_tool/README.md for detailed setup
   ```

3. **Set up Web Interface**
   ```bash
   cd validation_tool
   yarn install
   npx ts-node upload-server.ts     # backend
   yarn dev                         # frontend
   # See validation_tool/README.md for detailed setup
   ```
